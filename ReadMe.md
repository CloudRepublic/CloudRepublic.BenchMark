# Serverless BenchmarkWe've created a continuous benchmark tool for Azure Functions to measure the performance differences between Linux and Windows hosted Azure Functions. Secondly it measures the differences between functions written in C# .NET , NodeJS and Python. The performance benchmarking is only focussed on Http Triggered functions.## How the benchmark is executedThere's an orchestrator function that executes HTTP GET requests to every function app instance available. The first 5 calls are classified as coldstart, we then wait for 30 seconds to execute 10 requests per function instance to measure the warmed up HTTP requests.## Global Architecture- Github code repository.- Azure Pipeline builds and releases.- ARM for Azure infrastructure deployment.- Deploys 6 HTTP Triggered functions: - NodeJS (Linux) - C#.NET (Linux) - Python (Linux) - NodeJS (Windows) - C#.NET (Windows) - Python (Windows )- Deploys the benchmark orchestrator.- A SQL database to store the results.- An Azure Functions API with Azure API Management consumption tier.- Vuejs front-end hosted on Azure Blob storage with a CDN.  <img src='docs/global architecture.png' />## AuthorFlorian Schaal @ cloudrepublic.nl## LicenseMIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2019 Cloud RepublicPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
